# GTFH – “Go The F\*\*\* Home”

GTFH is an Android app designed to help you keep track of how long you spend in a specific area. Simply select a location on the map, and the app will start a timer when you enter that area. Once the timer reaches your preset limit, you'll receive a push notification reminding you to **GO HOME**. Perfect for staying on top of errands, work, or just making sure you don’t lose track of time!
